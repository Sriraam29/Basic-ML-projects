1.Diabetes Prediction
Objective: The goal of this project is to predict whether a patient is likely to have diabetes based on diagnostic measurements.
Dataset: Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset (available from Kaggle).
Techniques Used:
1.Data preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling).
2.Machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, etc.).
3.Model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall).

2.Fake News Prediction
Objective: This project focuses on detecting whether a news article is fake or real using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
Dataset: Fake News Dataset.
Techniques Used:
1.Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopwords removal, vectorization).
2.Machine learning algorithms (Naive Bayes).
3.Evaluation metrics (accuracy, F1-score).

3.Sonar VS Mine Classification
Objective: The project aims to classify whether an object is a rock or a mine based on sonar returns, using binary classification techniques.
Dataset: Sonar Dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Techniques Used:
1.Feature scaling.
2.Supervised learning algorithms (Logistic Regression).
3.Cross-validation and model evaluation.

4. General EDA for Data Analysis
Objective: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset to understand its structure and key patterns.
Dataset: Varies (can be applied to any dataset).
Techniques Used:
Descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode).
Data visualization (using Matplotlib, Seaborn).
Feature relationships (correlation matrices, pair plots).


How to Run the Projects
To clone and run any of these projects locally, follow the steps below:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/sriraam29/<repo-name>.git
cd <repo-name>
Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the individual project scripts (replace script_name.py with the desired project):
python script_name.py

Alternatively, explore the Jupyter notebooks available for each project.

Requirements
To successfully run the projects, make sure to have the following packages installed (listed in the requirements.txt):

1.pandas
2.numpy
3.scikit-learn
4.matplotlib
5.seaborn



Use the command below to install all dependencies:


pip install -r requirements.txt



Future Work
These are just the starting point for more advanced machine learning and deep learning projects. I plan to extend these projects with more complex models, feature engineering techniques, and larger datasets in the future.

Feel free to clone, explore, and contribute to the projects!
